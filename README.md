# Super Tic-Tac-Toe Ultimate
A 2-player game where the board consists of 9 tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3Ã—3 grid. Players take turns playing on the small boards until one of them wins on the larger board. Each time a player selects a cell, there's a chance they'll obtain an item. Items can be used before each turn. Players can upgrade items by crafting two base items together.

This project was developed as the final assignment for my Programming Methodology course during my freshman year (2023). It demonstrates my early understanding of object-oriented programming, game logic implementation, and software design principles.
